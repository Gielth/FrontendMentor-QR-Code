## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
    I've separated the whole part with the QRcode, writing in sections and gave it an id and then build everything with CSS3.
- CSS custom properties
    although I concluded what was being asked, I'm definitely know it can be improved, it's not the best working design...
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned very little on doing this one, I mainly select it due to working on improving my usage of html and css on my learning process as a whole. the main thing is that I used flexboxes and object-position.
