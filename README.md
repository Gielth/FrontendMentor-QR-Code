## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
    I've separated the whole part with the QRcode, writing in sections and gave it an id and then build everything with CSS3.
- CSS custom properties
    although I concluded what was being asked, I'm definitely know it can be improved, it's not the best working design...
- Flexbox


### What I learned

So, when i learned HTML5 and CSS3, a lot of things passed by such as different uses of displays, different types of units of measures (px, rem, %, vh...) and so, first time I did, i solved, but due to some feedback, I've improved on my knowledge on the use of css, also, it was the first time I used the CSS grid, it's interesting, I know I can improve on it if I took the time, but I believe it's good for now, and I want to get to others challenges on the FEM.
